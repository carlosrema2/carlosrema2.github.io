# Weather Dashboard


## About

This is a basic application that allows the user to input any city and receive information about the current weather, as well as a predicted five-day weather forecast. 

After the user types in a city name, that city is automatically loaded into the user's search history through local storage, and appear as a handy list of buttons that the user can use to keep an eye on favorite cities. The search history buttons are kept to a maximum length of 8 cities, and duplicate entries are automatically filtered.
